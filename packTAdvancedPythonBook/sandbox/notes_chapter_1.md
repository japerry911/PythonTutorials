# Benchmarking and Profiling
- Profiling - the technique that allows us to pinpoint the most resource-intensive spots in an application
- Profiler - a program that runs an application and monitors how long each function takes to execute, thus detecting the functions in which your application spends most of its time
- Benchmarks - small scripts used to access the total execution time of your application
